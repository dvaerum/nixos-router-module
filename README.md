# Intro

This NixOS module make it easy convert NixOS into a home router and
later I ended up using it at work

I know that there (nixos-router)[https://github.com/chayleaf/nixos-router] exists,
but I wanted to use `systemd-network` and
also wanted to have a deeper understanding for how everything.

## Current features:

- VLANs
- Multi-cast
- DHCP server
- PXE Boot (experimentel)
